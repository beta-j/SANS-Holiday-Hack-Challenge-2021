# Hidden Floor Easter Egg #

#  
There’s a hidden floor accessible from Frost Tower and Santa’s Castle which can be accessed by changing one of the button elements in the browser dev tools.  The value assigned to `data-floor` can be anything other than `1`, `2` or `4`.

This takes you to a psychedelic room with a mean-looking space-turtle in the background!  Exiting the room then takes you to a spot somewhere behind Frost Tower.
