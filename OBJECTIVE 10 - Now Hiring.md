## PROCEDURE : ##

We start off with a very helpful hint in what Noxious O D‚ÄôOr tells us before giving us the official hints for this objective; *‚ÄúDr. Petabyte told us, ‚ÄòAnytime you see URL as an input, test for SSRF.‚Äô‚Äù*.

![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2021/assets/60655500/8a5442bb-084e-4d48-aa4b-109ffcbfe499)

This is particularly helpful since the Jack Frost Tower application form includes a field which expects a URL to a public *‚ÄúNLBI Report‚Äù* as input

Right away I notice that by placing some typical SSRF strings[^1] in this field I get a different output page on submission and that the page is trying to display an image called `<name>.jpg` (where `name` is the name entered in the application form).

In particular it looks like strings such as `file:///etc/passwd` and `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` trigger this kind of behaviour so I know for sure that the website is vulnerable to SSRF and is most likely using AWS.  In order to retrieve the results of these queries, I run the web form through Burp Suite so that I can see the raw data within `<name>.jpg`.

This way I was able to retrieve the contents of `/etc/passwd` and `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data` as expected.
Similarly by submitting `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/security-credentials` I found a user called `jf-deploy-role` and presumably `jf` stands for our old enemy; **Jack Frost**.  So by going back to the application form and submitting `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/security-credentials/jf-deploy-role` I got the following raw output:
```
	"Code": "Success",
	"LastUpdated": "2021-05-02T18:50:40Z",
	"Type": "AWS-HMAC",
	"AccessKeyId": "AKIA5HMBSK1SYXYTOXX6",
	"SecretAccessKey": "CGgQcSdERePvGgr058r3PObPq3+0CfraKcsLREpX",
	"Token": "NR9Sz/7fzxwIgv7URgHRAckJK0JKbXoNBcy032XeVPqP8/tWiR/KVSdK8FTPfZWbxQ==",
	"Expiration": "2026-05-02T18:50:40Z" 
```

And there it is ‚Äì Jack Frost‚Äôs `SecretAccessKey` in all its glory.  Super easy when you‚Äôve completed the IMDS Exploration Challenge üòä

`"SecretAccessKey":` **`"CGgQcSdERePvGgr058r3PObPq3+0CfraKcsLREpX",`**
