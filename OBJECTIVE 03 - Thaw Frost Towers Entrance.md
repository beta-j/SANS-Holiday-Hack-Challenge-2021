# OBJECTIVE 3 - Thaw Frost Tower's Entrance #

## OBJECTIVE : ##
>Turn up the heat to defrost the entrance to Frost Tower.  Click on the Items tab in your badge to find a link to the Wifi Dongleâ€™s CLI interface. Talk to Greasy Gopherguts outside the tower for tips.#

  <summary>Hints provided for Objective 3</summary>
  
>-	The [iwlist](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iwlist) and [iwconfig](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iwconfig) utilities are key for managing Wi-Fi from the Linux command line.
>-	[cURL](https://linux.die.net/man/1/curl) makes HTTP requests from a terminal - in Mac, Linux, and modern Windows!
>-	When sending a [POST request with data](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-perform-a-post-request-using-curl), add `--data-binary` to your curl command followed by the data you want to send.

## PROCEDURE : ##

Thereâ€™s an open window conveniently located close to Greasy Gopherguts â€“ Iâ€™m thinking I can probably do a Wi-Fi scan from somewhere near this window...
```console
elf@4979e808b4f5:~$ iwconfig
wlan0     IEEE 802.11  ESSID:off/any  
          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=22 dBm   
          Retry:off   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr=7 B   
          Power Management:on
```

Running `iwconfig` confirms that I have a wifi interface named `wlan0`, so I can now scan for Wi-Fi networks on this interface:
```console
elf@4979e808b4f5:~$ iwlist wlan0 scan    
wlan0     No scan results
```

No luck.... oh wait thereâ€™s another open window and I think I can spot a round access point stuck to the wall too!  OK, so letâ€™s give this another go:

```console
elf@b72ff8033ef5:~$ iwlist wlan0 scan
wlan0     Scan completed :
          Cell 01 - Address: 02:4A:46:68:69:21
                    Frequency:5.2 GHz (Channel 40)
                    Quality=48/70  Signal level=-62 dBm  
                    Encryption key:off
                    Bit Rates:400 Mb/s
                    ESSID:"FROST-Nidus-Setup"
```
That did the trick â€“ we now have an ESSID: **`Frost-Nidus-Setup`** which we can try to connect to using `iwconfig`.

Connecting to the (thankfully unsecured) Wi-Fi network we get a helpful MOTD:
```console
elf@b72ff8033ef5:~$ iwconfig wlan0 essid FROST-Nidus-Setup
** New network connection to Nidus Thermostat detected! Visit http://nidus-setup:8080/ to complete setup
(The setup is compatible with the 'curl' utility)
```

So I followed itâ€™s advice:
```console
elf@b72ff8033ef5:~$ curl http://nidus-setup:8080/
â—ˆâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â—ˆ

WARNING Your Nidus Thermostat is not currently configured! Access to this
device is restricted until you register your thermostat Â» /register. Once you
have completed registration, the device will be fully activated.

In the meantime, Due to North Pole Health and Safety regulations
42 N.P.H.S 2600(h)(0) - frostbite protection, you may adjust the temperature.

API

The API for your Nidus Thermostat is located at http://nidus-setup:8080/apidoc
```

Trying to register the thermostat seems useless at this point as it requires us to know the thermostatâ€™s serial no, but we know that we should still be able to change the temperature without registering.

If we `curl` to `http://nidus-setup:8080/apidoc` we can see that we are indeed allowed to change the cooler settings without registering and we are conveniently told that we can do this by using a `POST` request with a JSON payload.

Following the command structure suggested by the API itself, we can raise the temperature to a balmy 20 degrees:
```console
elf@290c75e4b151:~$ curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json'   --data-binary '{"temperature": 20}'   http://nidus-setup:8080/api/cooler
{
  "temperature": 19.77,
  "humidity": 66.63,
  "wind": 26.79,
  "windchill": 19.43,
  "WARNING": "ICE MELT DETECTED!"
}
```

This successfully thawed and unlocked the Frost Towerâ€™s entrance ðŸ˜Š
