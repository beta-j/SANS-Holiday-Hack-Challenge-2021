## PROCEDURE : ##

This is a super quick one just ran the following command to filter out any exif entries containing the word “Jack” and to display the preceding 40 lines to get the document’s file name.

# CHALLENGE 2 - Grepping for Gold #

## OBJECTIVE : ##
>Howdy howdy!  Mind helping me with this homew- er, challenge?
>Someone ran `nmap –oG` on a big network and produced this `bigscan.gnmap` file.  The `quizme` program has the questions and hints, and incidentally, has NOTHING to do with an Elf University assignment. Thanks!
